# File Compression Using Huffman Coding


We can arrive at the conclusion that this lossless data compression algorithm based on HUFFMAN CODING is one of the most efficient ways of encoding and compressing data. Using this, we are able to represent characters that occur more frequently with possibly lesser than 8 bits or 1 byte. Therefore, the number of bits saved by these characters greatly surpasses the extra bits which might possibly be used to represent characters that occur very rarely. This causes the compressed file to occupy (in best cases) less than 50 percent of the original file size that too without losing any kind of data !
